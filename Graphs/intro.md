---------------------------------------------------------------------

Adjacent-List:
-> Every node/vertex stores the list of its adjacent vertex.
-> You cant necesserily reach all nodes from a single node.


Adjacent-Matrix:
-> NxN(row X column),boolean matrix
-> 'N' is the number of nodes
-> Value at Matrix[i][j] indicates an edge form node 'i' -(to)-> 'j'

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Directed:
->One-way street.

Undirected:
->Two-way street.

Connected Graph:
->if there is a path between every pair of vertices/node.
