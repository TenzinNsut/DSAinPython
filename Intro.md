"""
# Don't just start coding

# Insted follow these steps:

1.) Understand the problem. Identify input & output formats.
2.) Tackle edge cases: some examples of inputs and outputs
3.) Come up with a correct solution, & try to explain it in plain English.
4.) Implement the solution and test it using sample inputs. Fix bugs and errors.
